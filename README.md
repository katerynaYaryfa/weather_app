# How to run this app:

## Install Flutter:

* Ensure that Flutter is installed on your development machine. You can download Flutter from the official Flutter website.

## Install Dependencies:

* Once Flutter is installed, you need to run the flutter doctor command to check for any missing dependencies and follow the instructions to install them.

## Clone or Create Flutter Project:

* Either clone an existing Flutter project from a version control system (e.g., Git) or create a new Flutter project using the flutter create command.

## Navigate to Project Directory:

* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Flutter project is located.

## Connect a Device or Emulator:

* Connect a physical device (phone or tablet) to your computer using a USB cable, or start a virtual device/emulator. You can use Android Studio or VS Code to launch emulators.

## Run the App:

* Use the flutter run command to build and run your Flutter app on the connected device or emulator.
* If you have multiple devices/emulators, you can specify the target device using the -d option.

## Observing Changes:

* Flutter supports hot reload, allowing you to see the changes in real-time. Simply make changes to your code and save, and the app will update without restarting.
 
## Debugging:

* Use debugging tools provided by your integrated development environment (IDE) such as VS Code or Android Studio to troubleshoot issues and find bugs.

## Stop the App:

* To stop the running app, you can press Ctrl+C in the terminal or use the stop button in your IDE.


Keep in mind that the specifics may vary depending on your development environment and target platform. Flutter supports both Android and iOS, so make sure you have the necessary SDKs and tools installed for the platform you are targeting.
